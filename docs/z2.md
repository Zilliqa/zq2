# z2

The `z2` tool allows you to run a simple Zilliqa 2 network locally for debugging.

You can invoke it like this:

```sh
$ mkdir /some/dir
$ cd /some/dir
$ git clone git@github.com:zilliqa/otterscan
$ git clone git@github.com:zilliqa/zilliqa-developer
$ git clone git@github.com:zilliqa/zq2
$ sudo apt install mitmproxy
$ cd zq2
$ cargo build
$ ./scripts/z2 run /tmp/some_dir
```

It will:

 * Generate some configuration in `/tmp/some_dir`
 * Start up some otel containers to do telemetry
 * Start a 4-node Zilliqa 2 network
 * Start otterscan
 * Start a mitmweb proxy so you can debug RPC calls
 * Start a faucet so you can get some ZIL.

otterscan runs directly to node 0 (without going through the proxy)
because developer tools in chrome gives a decent RPC debugger and this
allows you to see "just" the traffic from your app and from the
faucet without the otterscan polls getting in the way.

`z2` will set up ports as offsets from a port base, which is by default 4000:

```
ü¶è  JSON-RPC ports are at 4201+<node_index>
ü¶è  Otterscan: http://localhost:6000/
ü¶è  Spout is at http://localhost:6001/
ü¶è  mitmproxy port at http://localhost:6002/
```

In the future, we will also have the ability to manage persistence: watch this space.
